I build products from scratch. Currently Founding Engineer at [Pre6.ai](https://pre6.ai/), where I've taken product from zero to one - core systems, UI, landing page, target market research, positioning. The whole stack.

I believe code and design must be shaped by market forces - you can't architect in a vacuum. The best systems emerge from tight feedback loops with real users, not from grand upfront designs.

## What I Do

I write systems software in Rust and TypeScript. Distributed systems, databases, query engines - the infrastructure that has to work.

Before Pre6, I built data pipelines, a distributed SQL query engine, and various systems that needed to be lean and fast. I've been programming since I was 9, shipping professionally since 2017.

Philosophy: [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) + [TIGER_STYLE](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md) + [Hard-Mode Rust](https://matklad.github.io/2022/10/06/hard-mode-rust.html). No bloat.

## Current Obsessions

**Mathematics**: Working through Fermat's Last Theorem, elliptic curves, modular forms, and hyperbolic manifolds. Not for applications - pure obsession with deep structure.

**Systems**: Compilers (MLIR), computational geometry, concurrent programming. The hard problems at the intersection of theory and practice.

## Open Source

I maintain [raft-rs](https://github.com/spacewalkhq/raft-rs) - an async Raft implementation with zero-copy storage. Built [taper](https://github.com/vaibhawvipul/taper), an autograd engine with SIMD-optimized ops.

Contributor to [Apache Datafusion-Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhawvipul+is%3Aclosed) (Spark accelerator in Rust), [Arroyo](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhawvipul+is%3Aclosed) (stream processing), [Apache Iceberg-rust](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-rust/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhawvipul+is%3Aclosed), and others.

## Teaching

I teach Rust, Distributed Systems, and OS at [Empowered Coder](https://empoweredcoder.com/). Former visiting faculty at [Fergusson College](https://fergusson.edu/). I speak at Rust meetups in Pune, Bangalore, and Mumbai.

## Background

Mathematics degree (University of Pune), PG Diploma in AI/ML (IIIT Bangalore). The math background shapes how I think about systems - proofs before code.
