Hello! Nice to see you here. 👋

Founding Engineer @ [Pre6.ai](https://pre6.ai/) doing math and programming with rust + typescript.

I'm a software engineer with interest in distributed systems, parallel systems and databases.

I love topics around systems engineering and am currently excited about :
- Computational Geometry
- Programming Languages
- Compilers - MLIR
- concurrent and parallel programming

Previously worked extensively on distributed systems, OS, and database internals.

## My Journey

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Pune, complemented by a PG Diploma in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from IIIT Bangalore.

This blend of math and programming has shaped how I approach problem-solving, enabling me to work across diverse domains, from low-level systems programming to large-scale distributed systems.

I have been programming since I was 9. I started with C and HTML. I have worked on systems and codebases written in - Java/Scala, Rust and Python. A small stint of 1 year with C++.

I began my professional career in 2017, working on a wide range of projects, from developing scalable web scrapers and computer vision solutions to building data engineering pipelines and a distributed SQL query engine.

I like building systems. Lean, fast, and scalable systems. I hate writing bloated software.

My software writing philosophy is getting influenced by -
- Unix philosophy : Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
- [TIGER_STYLE](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md) and [Hard-Mode Rust](https://matklad.github.io/2022/10/06/hard-mode-rust.html).

I love teaching. I sometimes teach at [Empowered Coder](https://empoweredcoder.com/). I have taught courses on Rust, Distributed Systems, and Operating Systems. I have also taught a data science course as a visiting faculty at [Fergusson College](https://fergusson.edu/).

I like evangelizing open source projects and have spoken at various meetups and conferences. I have spoken at Rust Pune, FOSS Pune, Rust Bangalore and Rust Mumbai meetups.

I love sharing things I learn and work I do on my blog and X.

## Topics I'm Excited About (not expert in all of them but love learning about them)

### Computer Science:
- Distributed Systems
- Database Internals
- Operating Systems
- Parallel Programming
- Deep Learning
- Formal Methods and Proofs

### Mathematics:
- Real Analysis
- Abstract Algebra
- Topology
- Calculus
- Game Theory
- Probability and Statistics

## Open Source

I love contributing to open source projects. I think open source is a great way to build software.

I am working on projects like -
- [Apache Datafusion-Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhawvipul+is%3Aclosed): It is a Spark Accelerator written in rust and scala.
- [raft-rs](https://github.com/spacewalkhq/raft-rs) (maintainer and author): An understandable, fast, customizable and scalable async-await Raft consensus algorithm implementation with zero-copy and self-healing storage.
- [taper](https://github.com/vaibhawvipul/taper) - An autograd engine with dynamic computational graph and neural network library. Uses optimized BLAS for matmul and SIMD for element-wise operations. Zero-copy tensors.
- [arroyo](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhawvipul+is%3Aclosed): A distributed stream processing engine written in rust.

I've also made minor contributions to [Apache Iceberg-rust](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-rust/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhawvipul+is%3Aclosed), [ParadeDB](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhawvipul+is%3Aclosed) etc.
