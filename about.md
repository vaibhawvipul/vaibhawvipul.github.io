Hello! Nice to see you here.

I'm a software engineer with around 7 years of experience working in the field of data, where I've held roles as a data scientist, data engineer, and now as a developer of big data tools and software engineering in general.

I have a deep passion for systems engineering and am currently excited about :
- concurrent and parallel programming
- distributed systems
- operating systems
- databases

I'm love contributing to open source projects. I am working on projects like -
- [Apache Datafusion-Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet): It is a Spark Accelerator written in rust and scala.
- [raft-rs](https://github.com/spacewalkhq/raft-rs) (maintainer and author): An understandable, fast, customizable and scalable async-await Raft consensus algorithm implementation with zero-copy and self-healing storage.

I've also made minor contributions to Apache Iceberg-rust and ParadeDB.
