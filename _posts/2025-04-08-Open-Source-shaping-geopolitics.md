## Open Source shaping geopolitics

Open source has moved on from being an ideological movement to a geopolitical lever. These days POTUS has imposed insane tariffs across the world. [36% on China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_second_Trump_administration) at the time of writing and [threatening it to move to 50%](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/mistake-on-top-of-a-mistake-china-hits-back-at-trumps-additional-50-tariff-threat/articleshow/120080164.cms). China is threatening to retaliate with 'reciprocal tarrifs'. The world is moving towards a new tarrif-driven tech cold war.

The impact was global. The US markets were down by ~15% post tarrif news. It introduced a lot of uncertainty in the markets. Will it remain the same? Will it go up? Will it go down? The markets were in a state of flux.

So were the Indian markets. The Indian markets were down by ~5% post tarrif news.

Indian IT companies were down by ~10% post tarrif news. The Indian IT companies are heavily dependent on the US markets.
