## Context: Tarrifs and Geopolitics

These days POTUS has imposed insane tariffs across the world. [36% on China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_second_Trump_administration) at the time of writing and [threatening it to move to 50%](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/mistake-on-top-of-a-mistake-china-hits-back-at-trumps-additional-50-tariff-threat/articleshow/120080164.cms). China is threatening to retaliate with 'reciprocal tarrifs'. The world is moving towards a new tarrif-driven tech cold war.

The impact was global. The US markets were down by ~15% post tarrif news. It introduced a lot of uncertainty in the markets. Will it remain the same? Will it go up? Will it go down? The markets were in a state of flux.

So were the Indian markets. The Indian markets were down by ~5% post tarrif news.

Indian IT companies were down by ~10% post tarrif news. The Indian IT companies are heavily dependent on the US markets.

It was not that people were not expecting it. The magnitude of the tarrifs was unexpected. Literally everyone was affected by it. Also, it will be hard to roll back the tarrifs.

## Open Source and Geopolitics

China has always been a proponent of open source. I am not sure if it is because of state-driven or state-sponsored mandate.
