# Building Engineering Teams That Push Boundaries

The best engineering teams have people who **question defaults** and They treat systems as **malleable clay**, not sacred scripture.

**Experimentation** should be in DNA of any tech team, especially in startups. This is what I call the **Hacker Ethos**.

The goal is not anarchy or chaos but fueled innovation and encouraging curiosity.

Companies like Stripe or Meta have engineering cultures that encourage **pushing boundaries**.

This is what Stripe says about their engineering culture:

The goal is **collective curiosity**, not individual rebellion.

Teams that normalize boundary-testing stay ahead because they discover what's actually possible — not just what everyone assumes is impossible.

## How to Foster Hacker Ethos in Your Team

1. **Encourage Questions**: No idea is too small or too radical to explore.
2. **Extremely Fast Iteration**: Rapid prototyping and iteration cycles is the delta is small engineering teams. The faster you can test and learn, the quicker you can innovate.
3. **Extreme Care and Ownership**: While encouraging experimentation, ensure that team members take full ownership of their work. This balance between freedom and responsibility is crucial.
4. **Impact first thinking**: Engineering teams which have top down approach from impact-to-implementation tend to be more powerful than implementation-to-impact. This means starting with the problem and working backwards to the solution, rather than starting with a solution and trying to find a problem it solves.
