## Setup and Binomial Model

### Setup
Consider a network of $$N$$ nodes. Initially, only the leader is informed, and it starts the gossip. In each round $$t$$, each informed node sends a message to $$k$$ randomly chosen neighbors, attempting to spread the message. Let $$I_t$$ be the number of informed nodes and $$U_t = N - I_t$$ the number of uninformed nodes at the start of round $$t$$. Another assumption is that the message size is small enough to be delivered in a single request.

### Binomial Model
The number of newly informed nodes in round $$t$$, $$X_t$$, follows a binomial distribution:

$$
X_t \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p), \quad \text{where } p = \frac{U_t}{N}.
$$

Here, $$n$$ is the total number of gossip attempts, and $$p$$ is the probability of selecting an uninformed node.

## Poisson Approximation and Failure Probability

### Poisson Approximation
For large $$n$$ and small $$p$$, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter:

$$
\lambda = n \cdot \frac{U_t}{N}.
$$

Thus, $$X_t$$ can be written as:

$$
X_t \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda).
$$

### Failure Probability
Using the Poisson probability mass function (PMF), the probability of no new nodes being informed in round $$t$$ is:

$$
P(X_t = 0) = e^{-\lambda}.
$$

The probability that a specific node remains uninformed after $$n$$ rounds is:

$$
P(\text{Failure after $n$ rounds}) = \prod_{t=1}^n e^{-\lambda_t} = e^{-\sum_{t=1}^n \lambda_t}.
$$

### Cumulative Success
The expected number of informed nodes after $$n$$ rounds is:

$$
E[\text{Informed Nodes}] = N \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot n}\right).
$$

For $$n > 10, e^{-\lambda \cdot n}$$ becomes negligible, meaning nearly all nodes are informed.

## Conclusion

By modeling the gossip protocol as a binomial process and approximating it with a Poisson distribution, we see that the failure probability decreases exponentially with the number of rounds. For $$n > 10$$, the probability of a node remaining uninformed drops below $$0.05$$, ensuring reliable message dissemination. The result is true for sufficiently large $$N$$ and small $$p$$.
